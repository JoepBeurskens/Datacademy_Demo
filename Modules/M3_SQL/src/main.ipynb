    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Open the command prompt in VS Code by pressing <b>CTRL</b> + <b>`</b>. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git status</code> to check which differences there are between your current and the master branch. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git add Modules/M3_SQL/</code> to add the main notebook to the staging lane. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Write the command <code>git commit -m \"<i>[INSERT COMMIT MESSAGE]</i>\"</code> to commit the staged changes and adding a descriptive commit message. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Finally, write the command <code>git push</code> to push the staged changes to the master branch. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Upon pushing the changes, the PyTest modules will be run to check your answers, for which an overview is generated in your Github </li>\n",

    "If you pass all tests, feel free to continue to our next module, <b>Module 4: Machine Learning (ML)</b>.\n",
